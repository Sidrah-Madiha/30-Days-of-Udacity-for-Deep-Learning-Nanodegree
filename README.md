I encourage @FridaR and @THIYAGARAJANR

**Day 3/30 (14th. Dec, 2019):**  TO **Day /30 (16th. Dec, 2019):** 
- Started CycleGAN implementation for translating images from Summer to Winter and vice versa, I coded it in Udacity workspace but for running on GPU, started GoogleColab.

**Day 4/30 (15th. Dec, 2019)**
- Spent the day while fixing error on Google Colab related issues, like importing custom modules etc.

**Day 5/30 (16th. Dec, 2019)**
- Finally ran training for CycleGAN implementation, the results showed no change, turned out I had wrong variable returning in one of the function, fixed it and my [exercise of CycleGAN implementation for translating images from Summer to Winter and vice versa](https://github.com/Sidrah-Madiha/30-Days-of-Udacity-for-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree/blob/master/Exercises/CycleGAN_Exercise_untrained.ipynb) is completed
