# 30-Days-of-Udacity-for-Deep-Learning-Nanodegree
This repository is used to keep track of all the learning through out the nanodegree program including projects I completed and progress I made each day towards my pledge of 30 Days of Udacity

**Day 1 (10th. Sept, 2019):**
1.  Surveyed the course.
2.  Pledged for 30 Days of Udacity https://www.screencast.com/t/DLhH4qnF

 ## RESTARTING 30 Days of Udacity Pledge 
As they say 
> "Fall down seven times, stand up eight"

I had a serious family emergency which compelled me to stop all my activities and focus on that situaton only, now I am restarting my pledge, commitinh to start my learning more effectively than before. <br/>


**Day 1/30 (13th. Oct, 2019):** <br/>
1. Restarted pledge of 30 days of Udacity.
2. Completed and submitted first project "Predicting Bike Sharing Patterns" 
3. Read and got inspired from amazing [interview of Google AI's Maya Gupta](https://mlatgt.blog/2019/05/21/9-questions-with-google-ais-maya-gupta-teaching-computers-to-gamble-well-knowing-how-to-play-the-career-game-and-a-solution-to-boring-plane-rides/)
